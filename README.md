# Power-grid-optimisation
Power generation grid optimization
We want to optimize the production of green electrical power from 3 kinds of power generators (hydro-based, solar-based and wind-based). The maximum power production of solar and wind generators depends on their primary energy source, on the contrary to hydro generators which have constant maximum power of 5kW per generator.
